# 📝 To-Do List App

A simple yet powerful To-Do List application built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

The app also supports local storage, so your tasks persist even after refreshing the page.

## ✨ Features

- **❌ Delete Tasks**: Remove tasks individually or clear all tasks at once.  
- **✔️ Mark as Completed**: Toggle tasks as completed by clicking on them or toggle it back to pending.

  - 🗂️ View all tasks.  
  - ✅ View only completed tasks.  
  - ⏳ View only pending tasks.  
- **🔎 Search Tasks**: Quickly find tasks using the search bar.  
- **💾 Persistent Storage**: Tasks are saved in the browser's local storage, so they are not lost on page refresh.
